# Hello-World-in-the-Cloud

In this project I build an infrastructure on AWS with Terraform. Terraform's backend is local. With the help of an EKS cluster, I have deploy a basic Node.js app which is reachable on the public internet by an external load balancer. The image which contains said app is built with docker and is a multi-architecture build (arm, arm64, amd64). In the /overview directory, an image about the infrastructure's topology and a dependency graph can be found. If opened in any browser, the graph will show the dependencies of all the infrastructure objects.
